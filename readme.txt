== Description ==

The Tillit plugin for WooCommerce allows you to offer your business customers to pay by invoice directly in the check-out. With Tillit, your trade customers get instant payment terms without leaving disrupting the shopping experience. Making your customers wait for payment terms and credit approval lowers your conversion rate – that’s why we skip the waiting.

Tillit is an easy way to offer trade customers their preferred way of payment. Choose the product that is the best fit for you. Set the number of payment days, if you would like your invoice to be funded and choose your risk threshold. Keep the control, but skip the time consuming bureaucracy.

Tillit has no setup fees, no monthly fees, and no hidden cost. Try our solution for free for three months, and experience the breeze of B2B payment.
